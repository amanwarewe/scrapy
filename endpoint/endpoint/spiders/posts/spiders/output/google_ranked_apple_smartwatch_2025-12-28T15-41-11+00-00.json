    "title": "DOJ sues Apple over iPhone monopoly",
    "body": "The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.\n\nFederal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, FaceTime and news offerings.\n\n“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as investors anticipated the lawsuit.\n\nThe Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.\n\nThe challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden business model. The company says that complying with regulations costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new products or services, and could hurt customer demand.\n\nThe lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which reported $85 billion in revenue.\n\n“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the release.\n\nApple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the lawsuit and that it would defend against it.\n\n“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people’s technology.”\n\nThe lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other technology companies to depress salaries.\n\n“This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the complaint said.\n\niMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming\n\nThe complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.\n\nProsecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.\n\n“Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview at a Vox Media event.\n\n“Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.\n\nThe DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.\n\nThe DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent Meta.\n\nApple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to its policies under California law.\n\n“Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the release.\n\nThe company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app store 50 cents per download.\n\nApple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify about whether the music streaming service can link to its website and account system inside of its app.\n\nApple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nApple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its dominant search position and another year over its advertising business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/doj-sues-apple-over-iphone-monopoly.html",

Normally I might have dismissed it and check again the next morning  but since i knew I was leaving really early the next morning and would be hours away from real medical assistance I decided to be extra careful and went to the emergency room just to make sure everything was ok. Turns out I had developed an Atrial flutter causing my heart to beat at 150bpm non stop. Next thing I knew is was admitted to hospital After 12 hours of treatment my heart rate was still going at 150 bpm so they reset it with an electroshock. According to the doctor an Atrial flutter is not necessary life threatening but if I had spent 4 days dancing and indulging I would have put myself at very serious risk. Throughout the entire episode I never experienced any symptoms, my heart didn’t feel like it was racing, I wasn’t feeling dizzy or experiencing any pain, in fact I was feeling pretty good.

Participation was voluntary, if the average number of steps is greater than or equal to a 5K per day all participants get a Friday half day. The person with the most steps overall wins an Apple Watch.

I love running and asked if steps from running could be counted. Matt, who volunteered to manage the competition said it did.\n\nMy goal was 20,000 steps a day thinking this would easily put me in the lead but on day 1 this guy Dave posted 23,000. I sent him a message on teams, saying something along the lines of “it’s on!” The next day I put up 24,000. He answers back with 25,000. Another coworker Jenna also joined in. The 3 of us started having daily chats about our workouts\n\nBy week 2 it’s looking certain 1 of us will win and the whole group is absolutely getting a half day off work\n\nThen I checked the log and out of no where, Tiffany, who’d been posting 10-15,000 per day, posts 65,000 steps\n\nFor perspective, a marathon I ran resulted in 52,000. So I’m skeptical but also, maybe Tiffany ran a casual ultra marathon on a workday? Who knows. I sent her a teams message “That’s a lot of steps, what’s your secret?”\n\nShe said she plays volleyball and wanted to count the steps from her games but can’t safely keep her phone or watch on her to keep count. To solve this problem, Matt looked up a chart online that gives a step equivalent for other activities\n\nEx: volleyball = 89 steps per minute Tennis = 133 spm Etc\n\nFair enough but the math still ain’t mathin so I said “wow, you must have played for like 8 hours!”\n\nHer reply “well i also road my bike”\n\nNow this is where I call bullshit so I clarified “you counted riding your bike?”\n\nTurns out she didn’t just use the chart for volleyball, she used it to count everything she did and convert it into steps\n\nBike riding, stretching, yoga, washing the dishes. All great but those are not STEPS. This seemed pretty lame to me and I just said “I don’t think that’s really in the spirit of this competition”\n\nAnd immediately went to Matt to ask about this chart. Specifically if bike riding counted towards steps. He said bike riding didn’t count, it was too different and also unfair since not every employee has access to a bike. I thanked him for clarifying and told him that Tiffany may also need some clarification\n\nNot 2 minutes later I get this message from Tiffany “Really, you complained about me? That’s actually not in the spirit of the competition. I lost a pet recently and have been so depressed. I’ve been struggling to lose weight and I was so proud of my steps from yesterday! Not everyone can be a marathon runner like you, really uncool”\n\nI knew I was being a little cheeky going to Matt but Tiffany’s message really took me by surprise. Am I the ass hole?\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**flyingmonkey5678461** YTA. For taking it too seriously. The corporate version (paid portal usually associated with a health insurance company, I've worked and done this 3 places at least) where they have these \"walking\" competitions all have them set up like this usually. So the people who do gym twice a day easily rack up a lot of points. Gardening counts as well as you expend more calories than just plain walking. Matt is a doormat though. He had a chart. He told people to use the chart. You didn't. He changed his mind after you pushed him. Poor guy is probably regretting organising this now.\n\n&gt; **OOP** I learned about the chart from Tiffany, it wasn’t something presented to the whole group\n\n**kokoronokawari** NTA, cheating is lame\n\nWho won though?\n\n&gt; **OOP** Competition ends next week\n\n**InedibleCalamari42** I want to know about Dave.\n\n&gt; **OOP** Dave’s cool. We never really had a reason to interact at work before just given our roles. He’s training for a triathlon (can confirm he doesn’t count the biking or swimming he does towards this competition)\n\n**discusmeniscus** Was it this https://www.steptember.us/ ?\n\nThis competition allows entering in other activities, which are then converted to their step equivalents. Everything from house chores, yard work and playing with kids.\n\n&gt; **OOP** It’s not that, we are just logging our steps into a shared excel doc on sharepoint\n\n**MincingAglet** How did everybody collect their step data to begin with? My smartwatch keeps a running total throughout the day. It doesn't matter if I am walking, running, riding a bike, washing dishes, scratching my nose...whatever movement that causing the mechanism in my watch to the point where it is recognized as a step will count as a step.\n\nThere are hundreds of devices that can track step data, and there are bound to be differences between brands. I've known people who use their phones to track steps, which I believe is just as valid as any other means of tracking. Heck, the very nature of the contest is built on winning a \"better\" device. If it is \"unfair since not every employee has access to a bike\", were steps taken to ensure that every employee had access to the identical method of capturing step data?\n\nThe playing field was never level to begin with.\n\nSorry, but YTA.\n\n&gt; **OOP** Initially folks were just meant to use a wearable if they had one or their phone, reporting is just on honors system. Manual entry to a spreadsheet. The chart for manually calculating steps was provided to Tiffany only, as far as I know, because she presented this issue of not having her phone on her while playing volleyball.\n\n***Verdict: NOT the Asshole***\n\n-----------\n\nUpdate [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1j3n68v/update_aita_for_reporting_my_coworker_for/): March 4, 2025 (2 weeks and 3 days later)\n\nSo the feedback on my last post made me feel like less of an asshole for sure but what happened next definitely got rid of any remaining guilt I may have had.\n\nTiffany won the steps competition.\n\nAfter I spoke with Matt he tried to clear things up with Tiffany but in his words she was “combative and rude” so he ended up looping in our HR rep, Jill. Jill decided that Tiffany could keep her 65,000 steps and the rules would just be clarified for everyone going forward.\n\nWell going forward Tiffany continued to post 35,000-40,000 steps every single day. Less ridiculous then 65,000 but still ridiculous considering we all sit at desks 8 hours day. It was still a tight race between the 4 of us, because we (Dave Jenna and I) had been posting higher then Tiffany prior to the 65,000 step day. Then Dave got sick. He only posted 4,000 one day and that was enough for him to fall too far behind. Then I had something urgent and time consuming come up at work and only got 10,000 steps that day. That was enough for me to fall too far behind too. So it was basically up to Jenna at that point and she was really working for it. Even got up at 4am the last couple days of the competition to try and max out steps. The highest she ever got to was about 41,000 and in the end Tiffany beat her by about 250 steps overall.\n\nTiffany had zero issue happily accepting her award at the next company wide meeting and gave this super annoying speech about how “everyone did so great” and how in the end she’s “just glad we all became more active and healthy.”\n\nI never responded to the message she sent me about being depressed about her dog or whatever. At the end of the day, this is my job and I’m not trying to get into some messy and weird fight over an Apple Watch and an extra 4 hours on a Friday.\n\n**More relevant comments**\n\n**johnnymac_19** “combative and rude”\n\nThis should have led to a meeting with HR and a disqualification.\n\n&gt; **OOP** Yeah…Tiffany has gotten away with stuff like this before in more serious work situation too. I don’t get it.\n\n**wlfwrtr** Jill and Tiffany are friends?\n\n&gt; **OOP** Not that I’m aware of. Jill’s remote and lives in another state\n\n**LighthouseonSaturn** My work has a App Rule. You have to use an App to count your steps, and if you don't have a phone or device capable of counting steps, they give you a tiny little beeper sized step counter.\n\nIt's ridiculous that she obviously cheated and didn't feel ashamed by it. Tells you what kind of person she is.\n\n&gt; **OOP** This did drive me crazy. They should have required some type of proof instead of just relying on the honors system.\n\n**booch** Out of curiosity, once it was made clear she was allowed to cheat, why didn't you just have everyone report as many steps as they wanted to each week. And then meet privately to share real step numbers with each other, for your own benefit.\n\n&gt; **OOP** For me the best case would have been to win honestly and for her to cheat and still lose. Obviously didn’t work out that way but I figured if I lost I would have at least gone down fighting the good fight. (This sounds way more dramatic then I feel about this but idk how else to explain it)\n\n-----------\n\n**Reminder: I am NOT the OOP.**",

    "title": "AITA for refusing to wake my wife up in the morning?",
    "body": "My (38m) wife (37f) have 3 young kids including a 6mo baby who still sleeps in our room.\n\nI'm an early bird. I routinely get up at \\~5:30am to enjoy a few silent moments of sanity and get some shit done before the kids take over.\n\nMy wife is a night owl and \\*hates\\* waking up. As a kid growing up her family nicknamed her \"The Lion\" on account of her morning temperament and blonde bedhead. They would draw straws and the loser would have to get her up in the morning. This topic made it into wedding speeches and continues to be a running joke to this day.\n\nThat said, she comes by this honestly these days. We're chronically sleep deprived because kids. She's on mat leave and is up 1-2x in the night nursing while I'm blissfully passed out beside her, so I don't blame her for pushing her wakeup times. I also don't blame her for staying up later, as once the kids go down around 7:30pm, then we put the house back together, then we get stuck to the couch recovering from the day, and \\*then\\* she might get an hour to watch TV before we do it all over again.\n\nHere's the issue: she always asks that I 1) wake her up in the morning and 2) ensure she's awake \\~10min later.\n\nThis has frustrated me from the start. I suggested she use a silent/vibrating phone alarm or her Apple Watch if she's concerned about waking the baby, but apparently those aren't good enough. FWIW I wear my Garmin smartwatch \\*and\\* a cheap $20 dumb silent vibrating alarm wristband that could wake the dead. \n\nThere's been a few times where I've agreed to wake her up at a certain time, but forgot &amp; woke her up \\~15min later. It usually doesn't cause any issues but today  I got her up at 7:20am instead of the agreed-upon 7:00am as I lost track of time attending to my son who woke up early. \n\nIt was a particularly difficult morning with cranky kids and she snapped about how it was just too late to get up with not enough time to get everyone ready. I reached my breaking point and snapped back that moving forward I absolutely refuse to wake her up in the morning &amp; that she's a big girl who can be responsible for herself.\n\nSince then she's made a few snide comments about random little things \"apparently being too much to ask\" and says I'm being unreasonable by refusing to get her up &amp; and make sure she's actually awake after she inevitably falls back asleep. I told her if it's not that much to ask then it should be simple enough for her to do it herself.\n\nSo, AITA? I can understand infrequent critical moments like \"please make sure I'm awake so I don't miss my flight\" but making me responsible for her daily wakeup times is absolutely unreasonable at best, even if kids and sleep deprivation are in the mix. \n\n**EDIT:** Sincerely did not expect this much traction! I'm glad I posted to help gain the perspective. Thanks everyone for their constructive and not-so-constructive comments.\n\nParents will understand: this is one slice - albeit a large one - out of the overall context of parenting. When baby was taking a bottle I was up several times nightly as well. I am also primarily on overnight \"sooth\" duty when little dude wakes up before a feeding as I'm able to get him back to sleep when he's furious whereas non-nursing-soothing fails for my wife because he goes straight for the boob. My wife hates pumping and we've agreed upon the split of night feedings as I take up the slack in other areas. Of our relationship issues, zero involve kid-raising. We regularly convey our appreciation for each other in being on the same page parenting-wise as much of our social and family circle is dealing with stereotypical uninvolved parent stuff. \n\nI also WFH and routinely rearrange my workday to parent. One kid is part-time daycare, part-time home so I've dipped out of meetings to help get him dressed to go outside, feed the kid lunch when she's putting the baby down, watch the furious toddler who won't get in the car when my wife goes to pick up our oldest from school, etc. so the \"oh wow dad gets to work all day and doesn't lift a finger with the kids and now he won't even wake her up, typical man\" responses are objectively wrong. Much of the derision in the \"you lazy fuck blissfully sleeping just get her a goddamn coffee she carried your children\" is a tiny bit misguided &amp; just a little heavy on the judgement without knowing the full context of parenting duties. \n\nWith **that** said, the more nuanced responses of \"nobody's exactly wrong here but cmon dude, parenting is hard, just wake her up and bring her a coffee, that's the nicest part of my day\" have resonated. It is exceedingly obvious in the responses who has been a gracious parent &amp; partner who has weathered the relationship struggles of maintaining a relationship while raising young kids, and who has not (saying this as a not-fully-gracious partner). \n\nRegardless of sentiment expressed, thank you all for responding, I'm on my way up with a coffee right now... albeit 5 minutes late as I was responding to this.

You can't take over one of the night feedings with bottle breast milk?  What is the timeline for the 6month old to be out of your room?  A baby at 6 months is capable of sleeping 6-8 hours straight through without needing a night feed. Your baby might be different, all babies are themselves with their own unique needs, but there are other options at 6 months than twice or more nightly feeds that ONLY mom and her boobs can provide. \n\nIs the 7am wake-up time something she's pushing? Why isn't it possible for you to the morning solo  and only get Mom up when it's time to head out for work/take the older kids to school or wherever their day is? If the main reason why she has to be up at 7am is 'she's the mom' and 'I want help'  I would encourage you both to rethink that. You can do the mornings alone. If she's the one insisting on being up while you are telling her to sleep, it's not really critical that she BE UP and you don't want to get her grumpy abuse every morning for not doing it right--then yeah, it's her job to manage her wake up time. She's a big girl. If there is a REASON--like a critical 2nd adult is required for child supervision--that she needs to be up between 7-7:30am daily, then you should really just be her get up buddy. That's real help that sound necessary for this phase of life. But you get to have ground rules, she can control her morning temper and explore some better back-up alarms.  But notice how two out of three of these options are just: she doesn't need to be up? \n\nFinally, while some of this sounds like normal mom stuff combined with her natural sleep rhythms being on the later side, 6 months is a pretty common point at which post-partum depression rears it's nasty head. It's probably a good idea to have that evaluated/re-evaluated.  Absolutely nothing makes sleep deprivation and getting up worse than depression. \n\ngood luck\n\nYTA.

    "body": "**BACKGROUND**\n\nMale / 5'6\" / 43 yrs\n\nStarted @ 155lbs\n\nCurrent @ 134\n\n\n[90 Day Transformation - BEFORE AND AFTER PHOTOS](https://imgur.com/a/ugMeq3z)\n\n\n**DIET**\n\nI started by cutting out sugar and sodas.\n\nI substitute sugar with stevia.\n\nI stated my macros with a 40/35/25 split of carbs/protein/fat.\n\nI choose this macro to ensure I was consuming enough protein in order to minimize muscle loss.\n\nI made sure to eat approx 0.85 to 1 gram of protein per 1lb of lean muscle mass in order to minimize muscle loss while dropping weight.\n\nWhen I first started getting serious, I was 155 @ 24% Body Fat. That means I had 118 lbs of lean body muscle (LBM) and 37lbs of fat.\n\nTherefore, I would consume 120 grams of protein which is approx 480 calories. The rest of my calories would go into carbs and fat.\n\nI'm a very busy parent and making sure I was consuming enough protein was a challenge. So to help out I would drink approx 2 protein shakes daily, one for breakfast and another with dinner. I usually added bananas or other fruits.\n\nSometimes I use peanut butter powder. I hate water in my shakes and found using Silk Almond Milk sugar free only had 30 calories per 8 oz. Worked great as a milk substitute.\n\nLunch usually consisted of oatmeal with cinammon and stevia with some Silk Almond Milk. These were my main carbs for the day.\n\nDinner included a lot of kale salads with veggies. I often added tomatoes, cucumbers, sliced carrots, radishes, etc..\n\nSometimes I'd add tuna or chicken breast if I needed to mix it up or hit my protein target. Salad dressings were mostly fat free or low calorie (approx 30-60 calories per 2 tablespoons).\n\nSides included microwaved baby red potatoes with some country crock, salt and pepper. These were great as I found my hunger would subside by eating potatoes and noticed the calorie to gram weight was a good balance compared to other types of carbs like chips, pretzels, popcorn or other snacks.\n\nSnacks included nuts, plantain chips, orveille redenbacher smart pop popcorn, celery or an apple.\n\n**CALORIES**\n\nI made sure to calculate my daily Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) without workouts.\n\nI then multiplied my TDEE by 7 to get my weekly calories so I knew how much I could consume for the week. I added 3500 to that number to get my maintenance calories. Subtracted 7000 calories so I could lose approx 2lbs per week and divided by 7 to get my daily calories.\n\nSo, at 155 lbs my TDEE was 1875. Weekly that was 13,125 calories. My total weekly workouts added another 4000-5000 calories for a total of 17,125 to 18,125 calories. From there I would subtract 7,000 calories to get a 2lb weekly weight loss. This meant I could only consume 11,125 weekly or approx 1,600 calories daily. However, it was important that I hit that 4000-5000 calorie weekly workout.\n\n**EXCERCISE**\n\nStarting around January 2019, I was almost 170 lbs, barely able to wear size 33 pants and really out of shape.\n\nI started eating healthier by eating oatmeal, veggies, salads and less fast food. By April 2019, I dropped down to 160.\n\nI started counting my steps with a tracker and targeted 10K steps per day. By June 2019 I was down to 155 where I plateaued for 6 weeks. That's when I got fed up at not making any more progress. Here's what happened next.\n\n**TOOLS**\n\n* Garmin Vivoactive Smartwatch\n\n* Jump rope\n\n* Wahoo Heart Rate Monitor (HRM)\n\n* Food Scale\n\n* Weight Scale that calculates Fat Percentage\n\n* Tape measure\n\nThe smartwatch helps me track my daily steps and connects to the Wahoo HRM when I do activities where I don't want to risk damaging my phone (swimming, mud races, etc..)\n\nJump rope is probably the best tool in my arsenal. It's cheap and highly effective in burning calories efficiently.\n\nFood scale is a must. I needed to know how much I was consuming so I could target how many calories I could eat on a weekly basis.\n\nThe weight scale with fat percentage calculation helped show that I was dropping fat % and not just weight.\n\nTape measure to help calculate body fat using online calculators.\n\n**SOFTWARE**\n\n* MyFitnessPal calorie counter\n\n* Garmin Connect activity tracker\n\n* Polars Polarbeat activity tracker\n\n* SyncMytracks Pro (Android)\n\n* Strong (Android)\n\nMyFitnessPal is AMAZING! I have it connected to my Garmin Connect Account where my workouts and steps are imported. From there I can see how I'm progressing. I can track my weight and upload photos as motivation. Seeing the progress via photos and graphs REALLY MOTIVATED me.\n\nI also use Polars Polarbeat activity tracker for my workouts, primarily because I do heart rate training workouts. From there, SyncMytracks exports my workouts and imports them into Garmin Connect which uploads them to MyFitnessPal.\n\n**WORKOUTS**\n\nOk, so I've learned A LOT over the last 3 months.\n\nThe BIGGEST TAKEAWAY is this... long periods of high intensity cardio is NOT the best for \"cutting\".\n\nI learned that short HIIT sessions are MUCH more efficient and effective.\n\nHere's my routines:\n\nMorning workouts consist of 45 minutes of low intensity cardio. This included riding a bike and jump rope.\n\nI would ride my bike and try to keep my heart rate around 115-135 BPM.For me that was approx 65-75% of my MAX HR. In this range, approx 25% of the calories I use/burn in my workout comes from fat which was my main target, not muscle growth.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, I would transition to a 10 minute HIIT routine where my heart rate is at 90% or more of my Max HR.\n\nAfternoon workout consisted of strength training. This is where I would weight lift, low weights high reps and high sets for about 45 minutes.\n\nI used the Strong Android app to track my workouts and see my progress.\n\nI followed [this article](https://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness-technology/4355/get-tough-mudder-upper-body-strength) as my workout routine for weight-lifting/strength training routines. Very simple to follow.\n\nThat's pretty much it.\n\nAs of now, my goal is to hit 130 lbs @ 10% body fat then start a clean bulk program to build muscle mass. I have approx 2 weeks to go.\n\nHope this helps and if anyone has more questions feel free to ask.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWOW!!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Thank you kind strangers for my first gold and silver.\n\nThere are a lot of questions about diet, workouts, tools, etc....\n\nI'll update with more details tonight. I've been answering by mobile so it's taking a long time to type this out. When I get home I'll update with more info soon as I get home.",

The processor is slow. The apps (especially 3rd party) have periods where they can't share data with the phone. As a medical device, I think the Apple Watch could be a major game changer as the hardware becomes more sophisticated and the software more mature. \n\nWith rumors of the Apple Watch 2 being announced in June, it is tempting to return the watch and buy the next one, which I expect to iron out the annoyances I have with the first model. But whether or not I do return this model, I will most certainly be picking up the Apple Watch 2. It's just too nice to see my blood glucose level without digging my phone out of my pocket. I also love being able to easily access my todo list and triage tasks from my wrist. Time travel is super cool. I think the watch is quite beautiful.

Garmin watch with HR.\n\n\nI was out at a BBQ restaurant with some guys and we ended up in a challenge to each eat a \"Champions Plate\" of meat -- 5 or 6 different smoked meats and sides.\n\n\nI'm about 2/3rds of the way through winning this thing and my watch starts beeping like crazy. Everyone looks over at me, I read the watch and all it said was\n\"Abnormal Heart Rate Detected\"\nand I just lose it laughing.\n\n\nI'm a decently healthy person and don't typically gorge myself like that, so I wasn't worried, but I'm glad to know Garmin had that feature too.",

After wearing my watch and checking the heart rate data for a few nights, I noticed that several times in the middle of the night my heart rate would shoot up to 150+ bpm. I saw a cardiologist who thought the watch was malfunctioning but agreed to send me home with a halter monitor anyway. \n\nThe monitor confirm the watch data and I’m now probably going to live an extra 10-20 years by making lifestyle changes to mitigate the condition.",
