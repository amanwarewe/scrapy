    "title": "DON’T SECOND GUESS! JUST BUY IT ✅ 2-DAY REVIEW",
    "body": "Figured I would officially write my first post in here after about 6 weeks of research by combing through subreddits, videos, articles, etc… \n\nHave always been very active from being an athlete all my life and now the line of work I am in as well. Training regiment of about 6-7 days a week. All that to say… I have been doing all of this off an Apple Watch Series 7 the last 3-4 years, so it was time to make the decision. Upgrades to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 or switch all together into Garmin. Long story short I finally decided to go with Garmin Fenix 8 and just after 2 days (all while still wearing my Apple Watch to cross reference the data) \n\nHere’s my review:\n\nThe watch is sleek. It helps with my line of work where you normally are around Tactix’s or the Fenix’s. It looks and feels exactly how it should. It’s  very comfortable overall. \n\nThe AMOLED is really amazing. I can’t speak on the MIP or Solar versions and the difference from this to those but from the Apple Watch (once again, series 7 so a little outdated) this thing (Garmin) shines like a diamond. \n\nI have also enjoyed with the garmin for some reason (which is what I love / have noticed) I don’t feel like I have to check my phone the second I get a message or email - unlike on the Apple Watch, I do. This may just be a weird nuance I noticed but really appreciate it. \n\nAs for my strength training and METCON work these past 2 days, the Garmin definitely hits close to AVG HR and calories. I feel more comfortable knowing the Garmin is actually a little more accurate. It threw me off the first day with the sets, reps, and weight during the workout and at first, I kept forgetting to stop and go which I felt skewed my workout data.. but it didn’t.. The ability to see all of this data to lay out to where you ca edit sets, weights, exercises, etc was truly astounding. To the point where the data was so much that it made this purchase even more warranted. To see I moved over 24,000 lbs of weight in an hour even shocked myself. \n\nI am so excited to continue to see the other features once I wear the watch enough to provide me the other data: sleep, recovery, training readiness, etc.. \n\nI heard someone say it best, with Apple you get a Smartwatch.. With Garmin you get a fitness watch. \n\nWill do another review in about 4 weeks if this pot gets interest but truly needless to say, if you are active, love data, love to train above average, then seriously, I implore you to get a Garmin.

    "body": "Picked this up at a thrift store today and was surprised to learn it’s an official Apple-licensed analog watch, not a modern Apple Watch and not a knockoff. Apple produced and licensed various pieces of merchandise in the 1990s, including quartz analog watches featuring the classic rainbow Apple logo and the “Think different.” slogan.\n\nThis model is a simple analog watch with Apple branding on both the dial and the case back, which reads “Apple Watch” — a term Apple used on merchandise long before the smartwatch era. It dates from the Think Different campaign period (late 1990s) and was never meant to be a smart device.\n\nIs it worth someting?  As a piece of Apple history and vintage merch, it’s a really fun and unexpected thrift find for €7.99.\n",
