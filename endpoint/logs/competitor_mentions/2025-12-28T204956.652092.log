         'knows a few web dev tech stacks with most recent titles of senior '

         'polished my resume with AI many times, applied to between 200-300 '
         'jobs in the span of 2 months. Got about 15 interviews, 4 offers. I '
         'think I could get more offers tbh but after I found the company I '
         'really liked I accepted an offer and stopped the interview process '
         'with the rest. I interviewed with Capital One, Visa, UKG, Amazon, '
         'Circle, Apollo, Citadel, FICO, GM and some no names or startups. '
         'That’s all to say that after reading reddit I was anxious to even '

         'on the candidate side. We are the ones who have drilled into your '
         'heads that you MUST have metrics, impacts and keywords or else your '
         'resume is "trash". Candidates are simply doing what they need to do '

         '\n'
         'Every job posting that our team puts up receives roughly 2000 - 3000 '
         'applicants within a day or two. Out of this 3000, maybe 300 make it '
         'past the initial automated resume screen and online assessment. Out '
         'of those 300, a recruiter might chat with 30-50. And from that pool, '
         'only about 20-30 candidates ever make it to the initial phone screen '
         'and subsequent onsites.\n'
         '\n'
         'Now here’s the part that really opened my eyes: once you’re sitting '
         'on the other side of the table long enough, you start to notice '
         'patterns, and one of the biggest is how much of what’s on those '
         'resumes is either overstated, strategically worded, or just not '
         'true.\n'
         '\n'
         'I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve brought someone in who '
         'claimed to have “architected a high-scale distributed system” and it '
         'turned out they wrote a couple of endpoints under heavy supervision. '
         'Or people who listed “launched a revenue-generating product used by '
         'millions” when, digging deeper, they built an internal tool with a '
         'handful of users. I’ve seen candidates inflate internship projects '
         'into “production systems,” or even list companies that, when we '
         'checked, they’d never actually worked at in any real capacity.\n'
         '\n'
         'A big one that’s become increasingly common is people lying about '
         'the technology stacks they’ve used. You’d be shocked how many '
         'resumes list technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Kafka as '
         '“production experience,” but when we ask follow-ups in the '
         'interview, it’s clear they’ve maybe followed a tutorial or briefly '
         'shadowed someone who worked with those tools.\n'
         '\n'
         'And here’s an important reality that most candidates (and even some '
         'hiring managers) don’t fully realize: background checks almost never '
         'verify WHAT you did. They usually just confirm your job title and '
         'employment dates. So if someone says they built a large-scale React '
         'application or ran infrastructure on AWS, there’s no background '
         'check that’s going to expose that as false. Unless an interviewer '
         'digs into the details, the exaggeration often goes completely '
         'unchallenged.\n'
         '\n'
         'And the thing is, many of these candidates still get interviews. '
         'Sometimes they even get offers. Not because they’re necessarily more '
         'skilled, but because their resumes are packed with the right '
         'keywords and “impact statements” that our systems and recruiters are '
         'trained to look for. Meanwhile, a candidate who honestly describes '
         'their experience with modest, accurate language often never even '
         'gets a shot.\n'
         '\n'
         'This creates a really frustrating dynamic. The people who embellish '
         'tend to stand out in the resume pile, which pressures others to do '
         'the same just to keep up. And from where I’m sitting as a SWE '
         'involved in this process, that pressure is entirely on us, the '
         'hiring side, for building a system that rewards buzzwords and '
         'inflated claims over substance and honesty.\n'
         '\n'
         'So if you’re sitting there wondering why you’re not getting '
         'callbacks despite real skills and solid experience, it might not be '
         'because you’re underqualified. It might just be that you’re '
