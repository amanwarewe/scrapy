 'body': 'I bought my first Motorola phone, the Moto G50, back in 2021 mainly '
         'because of the customisation and extra features Motorola offered. '
         'For a $200 phone, my experience was genuinely solid. It had a few '
         'issues, but that was completely expected at that price point. It '
         'built my trust in the brand, and that trust led me to buy another '
         'Motorola phone.\n'
         '\n'
         'In 2023, I bought the Moto Edge 40 - a decision I now deeply '
         'regret.\n'
         '\n'
         'At first, the experience *was* better, as you’d expect from a more '
         'expensive phone. However, everything changed after the Edge 50 '
         'launched; Motorola immediately began neglecting the Edge 40, and the '
         'software experience went from stable to one of the buggiest I’ve '
         'used on a smartphone.\n'
         '\n'
         'The worst offender is the Android 15 update, which arrived **11 '
         'months late** and still managed to break several core features:\n'
         '\n'
         '* **Volume controls are completely broken.** I can no longer press '
         'and hold on the volume buttons to change the volume; I have to press '
         'the button repeatedly for every volume step. The expanded volume '
         'panel is buggy, and pressing the volume keys can bring up the '
         'standard panel on top of it. Setting the volume too high while '
         'wearing headphones also causes the entire System UI to crash every '
         'time.\n'
         '* **Quick Settings customisations don’t save.** The phone pretends '
         'to save them, then randomly resets everything back to default a day '
         'or two later.\n'
         '* **Notifications from messaging apps are massively delayed.** '
         'Messages often arrive 10–15 minutes late, and when I open messaging '
         'apps, it can take a minute or two to actually sync across the latest '
         'messages.\n'
         '* **Bluetooth is unreliable.** The phone can’t maintain more than '
         'one Bluetooth connection at a time. I can’t connect both my '
         'headphones and smartwatch simultaneously, and my smart lightbulb '
         'constantly flashes when I enter the room because it repeatedly tries '
         'and fails to connect.\n'
         '* **Adaptive Charging is broken.** It says that "charging will be '
         'complete by” the current time (instead of when charging will '
         'actually end), then stops at 80% instead of slowly charging the '
         'remaining 20%.\n'
         '* **Several Moto gestures no longer work.** Power torch (karate chop '
         'to activate the flashlight), swipe to split, and quick launch '
         '(double tap the back to open an app) do not work anymore. Smart '
         "Connect also has severe latency (regardless of what WIFI I'm "
         'connected to) to the point where it is unusable.\n'
         '\n'
         'I could understand these issues if the update had been rushed, and '
         'then the issues were quickly patched, but Motorola had **11 months** '
         'between the release of Android 15 and its Edge 40 release, and this '
         'many issues managed to slip through.\n'
         '\n'
         'On top of that, the software is now increasingly filled with ads. '
         'The gaming tool shows game download recommendations while I’m '
         'actively playing a game, and the “Live Lock Screen” feature pushes '
         'ads and news onto the lock screen. While these can be disabled (for '
         'now), the direction Motorola is heading in is very clear.\n'
         '\n'
         'The build quality is also poor. The phone uses a vegan leather back, '
         'which insulates heat and causes severe overheating. The device '
         'regularly reaches **60°C or more** \\- to the point where it has '
         'physically felt like it was burning my hand - and I don’t even live '
         'in a hot country. When I contacted Motorola support about this, '
         'instead of looking into the issue, they gaslit me by telling me that '
         'they had "checked my device logs" and "the device had never reported '
         'temperatures above 45°C" (even though it was their official tool '
         'that reported 60 to me).\n'
         '\n'
         'Things escalated further when I noticed extreme battery behaviour. '
         'Initially, the phone began losing charge rapidly (around 1% every 5 '
         'seconds) once it dropped below 3%. A week later, this had moved up '
         'to 15% battery, which is a classic warning sign of battery failure '
         'or swelling. Internal temperature readings showed **80°C while '
         'idle**, and I couldn’t rule out physical bulging. At that point, '
         'continuing to use the phone could have been unsafe, so I got rid of '
         'it.\n'
         '\n'
         'I am now switching to Samsung and I strongly recommend that others '
         'do the same. Motorola is no longer the company it was five years '
         'ago. They behave like a hardware-only company that is focused on '
         'pushing new devices, while neglecting software quality, limiting '
         'long-term update support, and quietly omitting features (like blur '
         'and circle to search - both of which would work fine on the phone) '
         'to pressure users into early upgrades. This is planned obsolescence, '
         'plain and simple.',

         'Now I am older, wiser, richer, and with a hotter wife and better DD. '
         'So settle in and learn something. Or don’t, it’s whatever. When you '
         'last ignored me there was one key point in the ASTS Investment '
         'Thesis:\n'
         '\n'
         '1) ASTS Wholesale Model gives them access to billions of customers '
         'and thereby revenue.\n'
         '\n'
         '* All Satellite companies (save for SpaceX’s Starlink) have failed '
         'because they cannot effectively monetize their service. Technology '
         'isn’t a problem, it’s the go-to-market strategy which fails. ASTS '
         'has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing '
         'telecoms under the FCCs rules for Supplemental Coverage from Space.\n'
         '\n'
         '* Iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments '
         'in history, everyone who used it loved it. It was the only way calls '
         'could be made in NYC on 9/11, the only way to call out of New '
         'Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, it’s the first thing every person at '
         'the top of Everest reaches for, the list goes on.\n'
         '\n'
         '* The problem is that Iridium couldn’t sell the service. It was '
         'expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its '
         'use), people didn’t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not '
         'marketers), a market didn’t exist (maritime and remote villages and '
         'niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).\n'
         '\n'
         '   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&amp;T, '
         'Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all '
         'the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base '
         'for a service they want anyway (more on this later).\n'
         '\n'
         '      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with '
         'the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.\n'
         '\n'
         '      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every '
         'cell phone just works.\n'
         '\n'
         'That is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors '
         'since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long '
         'term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to '
         '1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered '
         'on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you '
         'are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:\n'
         '\n'
         '2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use\n'
         '\n'
         '* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just '
         'communications with cell phones.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile '
         'Tracking, for PNT, and more.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small '
         'wireless chip can use ASTS.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need '
         'connection. ASTS does that too.\n'
         '\n'
         '* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States '
         'Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million\n'
         '\n'
         '   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS '
         'communicating with existing Military Satellites.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into '
         'service.\n'

         '3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone\n'
         '\n'
         '* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where '
         'they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also '
         'be offering the service to the European Government much like the '
         'company is currently doing in the US.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in '
         'the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an '
         'entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.\n'
         '\n'
         '* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with '
         '“roman” salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine’s access to '
         'Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they '
         'need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.\n'
         '\n'
         '4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their '
         'own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from '
         'AT&amp;T and Verizon.\n'
         '\n'

         'interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.\n'

         '\n'
         '      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely '
         'discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of '
         'connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more '
         'upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).\n'
         '\n'
         '   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already '
         'designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.\n'
         '\n'
         '   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its '
         'partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.\n'
         '\n'

         'AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite '
         'connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect '
         'directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This '
         'groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global '
         'mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional '
         'terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array '
         'antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates '
         '"cell towers in space" which provide seamless connectivity without '
         'the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment '
         'like satellite dishes.\n'
         '\n'
         'Globally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access '
         '(World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in '
         'deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated '
         'regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing '
         'these individuals to access broadband services using any existing '
         'smartphone.\n'
         '\n'
         '*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of '
         'December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are '
         'constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion '
         'people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 '
         'million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.\n'
         '\n'
         'There are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of '
         'which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any '
         'modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA '
         'service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, '
         'particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial '
         'intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.\n'
         '\n'
         'ASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and '
         'developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial '
         'infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically '
         "challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's "
         'Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), '
         'which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space '
         'and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile '
         'Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has '
         'secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, '
         'AT&amp;T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments '
         "validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously "
         'offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like '
         'AT&amp;T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in '
         'otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower '
         'by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against '
         'the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing '
         'assets and valuable spectrum.\n'
         '\n'
         'Unlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as '
         'Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite '
         'footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, '
         "ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite "
         'antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile '
         'phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, '
         '"loud" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified '
         'consumer devices—contrasting sharply with traditional satellite '
         'phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite '
         "signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the "
         'total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, '
         'while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink '
         'already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global '
         'coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes '
         'efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital '
         'congestion and space debris.\n'

         'significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite '
         'endeavors, such as Iridium—which faced challenges not with '
         'technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex '
         'marketing—ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that '

         '**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers '

         'satellite’s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels '
         '(with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together '
         'with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often '
         'called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a '
         'contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without '
         'needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the '
         'satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, '
         'it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core '
         'enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large '
         'antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in '
         'orbit\u200b. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points '
         'of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering '
         'launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive '
         'antenna is critical for AST’s service capability.\n'

         'duplex (TDD) over satellite\u200b. In layman’s terms, because '
         'satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel – this system '
         'dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that '
         'echoes of a transmission don’t interfere with new data. For ASTS, '
         'this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones '
         'communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which '
         'improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the '
         'time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as '

         '**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This '
         'patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone’s location from '
         'space using the satellite’s phased-array antenna\u200b. The '
         'satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location '
         '(which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device’s '
         'position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The '
         'satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where '
         'you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and '
         'delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal '

         '**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a '
         'solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to '
         'connect directly to a satellite\u200b. The system involves a '
         'satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground '
         'infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to '
         'manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with '
         'the active users’ phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing '
         'delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into '
         'thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the '
         'long signal delay.\n'

         '**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent '
         'describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first '
         'tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network\u200b. The idea '
         'is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any '
         'phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a '
         'phone’s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then '
         'lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary '
         'signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the '
         'satellite first yells “anyone out there?” over a broad area, and '
         'when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted '
         'conversation with that phone’s sector. This on-demand beam switching '
         'is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by '
         'not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to '
         'cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more '
         'users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational '
         'costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when '
         'someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.\n'

         '**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a '
         'technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or '
         'satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input '
         'multiple-output) link for data\u200b. In simple terms, the base '
         'station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams '
         'through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a '
         'device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if '
         'capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive '
         'parallel data streams, boosting throughput.\n'
         '\n'
         '**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals '
         'with handing off a user’s connection from one low-Earth-orbit '
         'satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions\u200b. '
         'It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered '
         'by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a '
         'rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one '
         'satellite’s beam and then the other’s beam cover the same cell '
         'during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication '
         'links and switches the user’s session from the first satellite to '

{'author': 'Puginator',
 'body': 'The Department of Justice sued Apple on Thursday, saying its iPhone '
         'ecosystem is a monopoly that drove its “astronomical valuation” at '
         'the expense of consumers, developers and rival phone makers.\n'
         '\n'
         'Federal antitrust enforcement and 17 attorneys general also say that '
         'Apple’s anti-competitive practices extend beyond the iPhone and '
         'Apple Watch businesses, citing Apple’s advertising, browser, '
         'FaceTime and news offerings.\n'
         '\n'
         '“Each step in Apple’s course of conduct built and reinforced the '
         'moat around its smartphone monopoly,” the complaint filed in the '
         'District of New Jersey said. Apple shares were down around 1.8% as '
         'investors anticipated the lawsuit.\n'
         '\n'
         'The Justice Department said in a release that to keep consumers '
         'buying iPhones, Apple moved to block cross-platform messaging apps, '
         'limited third-party wallet and smartwatch compatibility and '
         'disrupted non-App Store programs and cloud-streaming services.\n'
         '\n'
         'The challenge represents a significant risk to Apple’s walled-garden '
         'business model. The company says that complying with regulations '
         'costs the company money, could prevent it from introducing new '
         'products or services, and could hurt customer demand.\n'
         '\n'
         'The lawsuit could force Apple to make changes in some of its most '
         'valuable businesses: The iPhone, in which Apple reported over $200 '
         'billion in sales in 2023, the Apple Watch, part of the company’s $40 '
         'billion wearables business, and its profitable services line, which '
         'reported $85 billion in revenue.\n'
         '\n'
         '“If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its '
         'smartphone monopoly,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the '
         'release.\n'
         '\n'
         'Apple said in a statement that it disagreed with the premise of the '
         'lawsuit and that it would defend against it.\n'
         '\n'
         '“This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple '
         'products apart in fiercely competitive markets. If successful, it '
         'would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people '
         'expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect,” '
         'an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. “It would also set a dangerous '
         'precedent, empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing '
         'people’s technology.”\n'
         '\n'
         'The lawsuit follows years of investigations into Apple’s business '
         'practices and two prior DOJ cases against Apple: One over e-book '
         'prices and another over allegations that it colluded with other '
         'technology companies to depress salaries.\n'
         '\n'
         '“This anticompetitive behavior is designed to maintain Apple’s '
         'monopoly power while extracting as much revenue as possible,” the '
         'complaint said.\n'
         '\n'
         'iMessage, Apple Watch, and cloud gaming\n'
         '\n'
         'The complaint highlights comments from CEO Tim Cook and other '
         'executives. Some users have asked Apple to improve Android-to-iPhone '
         'messaging. Developers have gone as far as creating apps that can '
         'circumvent the platform limitations, only to be shut down by Apple.\n'
         '\n'
         'Prosecutors highlighted one exchange between Cook and a consumer.\n'
         '\n'
         '“Not to make it personal but I can’t send my mom certain videos,” '
         'the complaint says one user told Cook, referring to a 2022 interview '
         'at a Vox Media event.\n'
         '\n'
         '“Buy your mom an iPhone,” Cook responded.\n'
         '\n'
         'The DOJ is also focusing on Apple’s smartwatch, Apple Watch, saying '
         'the company designed it to only work with iPhones, and not Android '
         'devices. The company’s decision means that “users who purchase the '
         'Apple Watch face substantial out-of-pocket costs if they do not keep '
         'buying iPhones,” according to the complaint.\n'
         '\n'
         'The DOJ said Apple has fought cloud streaming services on its App '
         'Store platform, blocking consumer access to high-quality video games '
         'on iPhones, echoing complaints from Microsoft and Facebook parent '
         'Meta.\n'
         '\n'
         'Apple has faced several significant antitrust challenges more '
         'recently, largely focused on its control over the iPhone App Store. '
         'It mostly won in a civil suit against Epic Games in 2021, although '
         'it made concessions during the trial and had to make some changes to '
         'its policies under California law.\n'
         '\n'
         '“Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Apple accountable and ensure it '
         'cannot deploy the same, unlawful playbook in other vital markets,” '
         'Assistant Attorney General for antitrust Jonathan Kanter said in the '
         'release.\n'
         '\n'
         'The company is currently jockeying with the European Commission over '
         'whether it’s complying with a new Digital Markets Act, which forces '
         'Apple to open up the iPhone app store to rivals such as Microsoft or '
         'Epic Games. Apple plans to charge big companies that eschew its app '
         'store 50 cents per download.\n'
         '\n'
         'Apple was fined $2 billion in the EU over a dispute with Spotify '
         'about whether the music streaming service can link to its website '
         'and account system inside of its app.\n'
         '\n'
         'Apple had 64% of the market share for U.S. iPhones in the last '
         'quarter of 2023, versus 18% for Samsung, according to Counterpoint '
         'Research.\n'
         '\n'
         'Apple isn’t the only big tech company facing government scrutiny. '
         'The DOJ filed an antitrust case against Google in 2020 over its '
         'dominant search position and another year over its advertising '
         'business. The DOJ also famously sued Microsoft in the 1990s, '
         'eventually forcing it to allow users to unbundle the Internet '
         'Explorer browser from the Windows operating system.\n'
