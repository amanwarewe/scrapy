 'body': 'I had an Apple Watch 9 for about a year and a half. I basically just '
         "used it to tell time (shocking!) and for notifications. I didn't "
         'really use any other apps on it, including health tracking. As such, '
         'it suited me just fine, but I was always curious about the Apple '
         'Watch Ultra. A few weeks ago I able to buy a used 1st-gen Apple '
         'Watch Ultra on OfferUp for $200. It was in great shape, with a '
         'battery health of 87% (not great, but manageable). To my surprise, I '
         'really, really liked it. I actually started to track my sleep and '
         'other health data, because I never had to worry about battery life. '
         'It would easily sustain more than two days, particularly since I '
         "didn't push it particularly hard.\n"
         '\n'
         'Then, a week or so ago, I saw an Apple Watch Ultra 3 (with 100% '
         'battery health) on OfferUp. The seller wanted to downsize to a '
         'regular Apple Watch since he felt the Ultra was too big and bulky '
         'for him. He was willing to trade for my Apple Watch 9 with an '
         'additional $400 on my part. So I ended up with a basically brand-new '
         'Apple Watch Ultra 3, while easily offloading my old Apple Watch 9. I '
         'ended up selling my 1st-gen Ultra for $275, so that all worked out '
         'pretty well.\n'
         '\n'
         'Anyway, I continue to love my Ultra 3. Here are some things I '
         'noticed about the Ultra 3 compared to Ultra 1:\n'
         '\n'
         '* They basically look exactly the same. (They may even be physically '
         "\\*exactly\\* the same—I don't know.)\n"
         '* It was super quick and easy to transfer everything from my Ultra 1 '
         'to 3 (and from Series 9 to Ultra 1 for that matter). I was up and '
         'running in minutes.\n'
         "* Functionally, the Ultra 1 and 3 aren't very different. While I'm "
         'sure the Ultra 3 is faster due to the newer chip (S10 vs. S8), you '
         "don't really notice that in everyday practice. BUT:\n"
         '* The battery life of the Ultra 3 is insane, even compared to Ultra '
         '1. Granted, I went from Ultra 1 with 87% battery health to Ultra 3 '
         'with 100%, but the difference between them is stark, not to mention '
         'compared to my old Apple Watch 9! The Ultra 3 easily lasts three+ '
         'days for me.\n'
         '* The Ultra 3 charges \\*way\\* faster than the Ultra 1, providing '
         'you use the newer charger that comes with it. I charge it to full '
         'every two or three days, while I take a quick shower in the morning, '
         "and I'm good to go for another couple of days.\n"
         '* I can easily wear the Ultra all night for sleep tracking. It '
         "doesn't bother me one bit—it's not too bulky or heavy in the least. "
         'However, the previous owner felt it was way too uncomfortable at '
         'night and that was one of the reasons I wanted to sell it, so I '
         'guess everybody has a different comfort level.\n'
         "* I'm finding the Trail Loop a lot more comfortable than the Sport "
         'Loop. (Unfortunately, the Ultra-specific Trail Loop is twice as '
         "expensive as the more generic Sport Loop.) I personally don't like "
         "the Alpine Loop; it's just too cumbersome to put on or take off. The "
         'Ocean Band is fine, but it feels quite different than any of the '
         'Loops. I also really like the '
         '[Bandletic](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQVNNZSQ) silicone magnetic '
         'strap, which is cheaper than any of the genuine Apple bands and '
         'compatible with any Apple Watch model and generation.\n'
         '\n'
         'In short, the Apple Watch Ultra is not just for hardcore athletes or '
         "outdoor fanatics; it's for anyone who appreciates the more rugged "
         "design and phenomenal battery life. Now, I wouldn't have paid $800 "
         'plus tax for a new smartwatch like the Apple Watch Ultra 3, but at '
         'the discounted price I was able to get it for I feel it was '
         'definitely worth it.',

         'a couple of key questions about message notifications:\n'

         '1). On smartwatches like Galaxy Watch / Apple Watch, when you tap '

         'you can scroll and read previous and newly arrived messages.\n'

         'each individual message?\n'
         '\n'
         '2). When a message arrives, is the message text cut/shortened, or '
         'can you read the full message on the watch screen?\n'
         '\n'
         'I want to be able to receive a large volume of messages (more than '
