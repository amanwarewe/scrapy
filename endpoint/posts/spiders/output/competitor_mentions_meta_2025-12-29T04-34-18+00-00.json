            "body": "Honestly im getting a tired of people complaining about war striders. Lets be honest with ourselves, Helldivers isn't about killing everything (unless its an eradicate mission) its about getting the job done and getting out not killing everything in you way like we are infallible gods who can't say they made a mistake bringing x or y to a front that demands immediate power. The same way we do our jobs the bots do theirs. We adapt to them as they adapt to us and the war strider was a direct result of us gaining power. Sometimes the real goal is to get back safe so instead of complaining that not everything kills war striders, complain that there's not enough tools to temporarily disable their strengths. Some say the auto cannon is useless on bots now despite it killing the War striders laser cannons in just a few hits. Its tiring to hear the same people crying for nerfs when Helldivers have access to so much power. There is a ton they can do to if they took two seconds to reflect on their actions. The same people complaining are the same ones who hate getting ragdolled yet refuse to bring things to take care of the most rag doll inducing enemy they have ever put in the game and yet they still act surprised when things don't change. People pretend like thermites, eats and above all else. the ultimatum don't exist.\n\nThis might be a hot take but I like that not every enemy has a super exploitable weakspot(s) and found that people who don't like this design are the same people think fleshmobs to be bad design. People want to pretend that everything deserves weak spots when those two enemies are EXTREMELY weak to certain tools across all weapon / stratagem slots. I find it a bit boring that the solution to alot of heavy bots is just hit em from behind and aim for the microwave. Id be mad if war striders had the same thing going, as if flanking isn't already incredibly useful especially against these guys as they take a ton of time to turn around and target as they have some of the worst aim among all the bots. If every support stratagem killed everything then the bot front would just be so played out. I don't think HMG or any of those other weps need to kill war striders reliably. I love my HMG and it deals with everything else.\n\nWar Striders are extremely balanced, they don't need a nerf, you just need to adapt. if you cant deal with them, change your loadout or ask someone else to pick up your slack. if you're out of resources by the time you find a pack of war striders, bring the supply pack to re-up your thermites and ultimatum shots and stims. If you're dying to them too much, bring fortified armor so you can get close and live through the laser barrages / grenade fields to throw a sticky or to live from the impact of your own ultimatum shots. If they are still a problem for you to the point you have to make memes months after their release complaining that your favorite gun can't take out this hyper tank thats meant to be a roadblock then pick another mission so that these aren't in your constellation or better yet and get off the bot front so that the rest of us can enjoy the game without hearing about how AH is forcing players to abandon guns.\n\nWhen I hear people say creativity is dead because the tools that were once used aren't able to kill ONE SPECIFIC MOB are missing the entire point of the game. This isn't a theme park, its a war, they bots saw that people were tearing through all their soldiers with scissors and staple guns and when they decide to bring out something that isn't immediately getting blown up ARROWHEAD IS RUINING THE GAME AND FORCING US ALL TO BE META SLAVES. Honestly, get over yourselves, its sickening to hear yall not be thankful that we got a whole new enemy in the first place. I don't care what any one says. I love bots, I love War Striders. I love thermites, I love the ultimatium and Im tired of this slander. Im not even joking when I say that I hope we get more enemies like them in the future.\n\n  \nTLDR: this isnt about getting gud, its about getting your heads out of your asses and waking up to realize that certain things in this game are made to deal with other certain things. The bots have eyes and can see whats happening to their guys on the ground. If you don't want to deal with them, don't play their missions. If you can't find what missions they're usually found in, then dont play the front. Stop asking the devs to make the game easier when there are a ton of ways to get around war strides outside of literally getting around them, doing the mission and getting out.",

    "body": "A Meta Apology happens when a story apologizes to its audience from inside the narrative itself.\n\n**South Park-ManBearPig:** In the episode ManBearPig, the show mocked Al Gore and ridiculed climate change as hysteria by portraying the threat as a ridiculous, imaginary monster. Years later, once climate change had become undeniably real in public discourse, the series revisited the concept and ManBearPig is revealed to be real.\n\n**BoJack Horseman–Reframing earlier seasons:** The series does not apologize directly, but it responds to its earlier tone through the story itself. In early seasons, BoJack’s treatment of Sarah Lynn and his emotional manipulation of Princess Carolyn are often played for dark humor. In later seasons, those same actions are revisited and shown to have serious, irreversible consequences. The show reframes what once felt like jokes as real harm, using the narrative to correct its own past.\n\n**Community-Repilot:** The premiere of season five directly addresses the widely disliked fourth season, the characters talk about things feeling off and about bad decisions that were made. By turning its own creative failure into part of the story, the episode works as a simple and direct apology to the audience.",

Years later with the King of the Hill reboot the role of Kahn was given to Ronny Chieng, and with the unfortunate passing of Johnny Hardwick, Huss took over the role of Dale.\n\nNow the fun part - maybe not an apology but certainly a meta acknowledgement in my eyes - comes in S14E3, wherein Bobby Hill attempts to procure authentic Japanese charcoal from Mr. Yoshida, who refuses to sell to Bobby as he is not Japanese. When Bobby meets Mr. Yoshida he's surprised to find that he is in fact a black man who was raised in Japan, leading to further confusion about race and culture until everyone learns a valuable lesson at the end.
