Based on recent coverage regarding the arrival of Microsoft Copilot on LG TVs, we want to clarify that Microsoft Copilot is provided as a shortcut icon to enhance customer accessibility and convenience. It is not an application-based service embedded in the TV. When users select the Copilot shortcut, Microsoft's website opens through the TV's web browser, and features such as microphone input are activated only with the customer's explicit consent.”",

I know they do sketchy shit but this is just dumb.  11 has literally 0 benefit for windows 10 users.  \n\nI challenge you to find one compelling feature of windows 11 that 10 does not have.  I do not consider integrated LLM spying to be a “feature”.",

It can’t follow prompts, recall past conversations as they relate to present ones, or give accurate information on basic questions. It just searches the internet for paid sources and offers them up. It doesn’t send emails, it doesn’t balance your accounts, it doesn’t do anything except consume massive amount of resources to train off its massive amount of data collection that we have been fooled as the product into paying to give our time and information. Get fucked Microsoft. This product is destroying the jobs of people that do a lot of important tasks, and the product isn’t even replacing the jobs. It just writes some slop email and tells me to do more work. The outputs have no fact check or human to verify so it makes me do quality control. Microsoft copilot is like a sophomore confidently masquerading as some repository of knowledge and efficiency and it’s neither. It’s a garbage tool propped up by elite techno feudalists.",
