    "title": "Is tech job market really cooked ?",
    "body": "I am SWE with 8 YOE. Nothing too niche, full stack developer that knows a few web dev tech stacks with most recent titles of senior and tech lead. No AI or ML. I was laid off in June. Prepared hard, polished my resume with AI many times, applied to between 200-300 jobs in the span of 2 months. Got about 15 interviews, 4 offers. I think I could get more offers tbh but after I found the company I really liked I accepted an offer and stopped the interview process with the rest. I interviewed with Capital One, Visa, UKG, Amazon, Circle, Apollo, Citadel, FICO, GM and some no names or startups. That’s all to say that after reading reddit I was anxious to even apply but I think I got a decent amount of interviews and negotiated my offers to be either at the higher end of the salary range for the role or even above advertised. I do recognize it’s much harder for junior engineers these days but is there really a shortage for experienced engineers? I haven’t felt that. I’m not even a native English speaker although I do speak English fluently. I’m in the US. I also didnt lie on resume or cheated during coding rounds. Some of them I solved 100%, some not. For example for C1 I got 450/600 points on CodeSignal and still got a callback and an offer after clearing their power day. Ask me anything I guess. Happy to help someone if I can. No referrals though, sorry. I’ve just started a few weeks ago, too early to refer especially someone I don’t personally know. Here are a few things that I believe gave me an edge or worked in my favor:\n- referrals from my network\n- local jobs that required hybrid schedule\n- tailored resumes\n- soft skills\n- activity on LinkedIn (mostly commenting)\n\nI also tried to outsource the filling out job applications part so I can focus on preparing and interviewing but I didn’t have much success with freelancers from Fiverr. I was also approached by a “do it for you” company but they charge % of your first year salary + a fixed fee and I decided to just do it myself.",

    "body": "My husband has been in senior exec-level tech jobs for several years now. He has 15+ years of niche technical experience that’s in high demand. An MBA. Presents and markets really well. I have personally witnessed him get high-paying job offers within days of looking (and sometimes just through inbound) maybe a dozen times. \nHe lost his job like many people in tech in spring. Since then, he’s applied to more jobs than his whole life combined. He’s applied to remote, non-remote, hybrid etc (we live in CA). He’s broadened his search to go down 2-3 levels and 100s of thousand in pay. He’s redone his resume through professional services. He’s doing custom direct messaging etc. anything we can think of. In these 6 months of looking and 100+ applications, he’s gotten a total of 4 HR screener calls that just died. Felt like the positions weren’t even real. We have savings but I’m starting to panic. This is the worst market I’ve ever seen and I graduated in 2008. Any tips? Any hacks? I think his skill level and seniority is actually hurting him but it is what it is.\n\n[EDIT to add]: WOW amazed at the outpouring of support and sympathy. Clearly this is a serious market problem if so many are experiencing the same. I’m not sure how to process this or respond to the situation. It just seems like you have to keep trying and hope for the best.",

    "keyword": "tech_market",
    "title": "[PSA] The real reason you're struggling in the tech market: Almost EVERYONE is lying.",
    "body": "(TL;DR at bottom of post)\n\nFirst let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not suggesting that you lie as well. That's an individual decision. I'm here just to tell you about my experiences as being part of the hiring process for a FAANG-adjacent company.\n\nSecondly, I just want to state right away that I believe this is an issue that stems from the hiring / recruiter side more than it does on the candidate side. We are the ones who have drilled into your heads that you MUST have metrics, impacts and keywords or else your resume is \"trash\". Candidates are simply doing what they need to do to survive in this crazy market.\n\nWith that out of the way.... let me tell you about my experiences.\n\nEvery job posting that our team puts up receives roughly 2000 - 3000 applicants within a day or two. Out of this 3000, maybe 300 make it past the initial automated resume screen and online assessment. Out of those 300, a recruiter might chat with 30-50. And from that pool, only about 20-30 candidates ever make it to the initial phone screen and subsequent onsites.\n\nNow here’s the part that really opened my eyes: once you’re sitting on the other side of the table long enough, you start to notice patterns, and one of the biggest is how much of what’s on those resumes is either overstated, strategically worded, or just not true.\n\nI’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve brought someone in who claimed to have “architected a high-scale distributed system” and it turned out they wrote a couple of endpoints under heavy supervision. Or people who listed “launched a revenue-generating product used by millions” when, digging deeper, they built an internal tool with a handful of users. I’ve seen candidates inflate internship projects into “production systems,” or even list companies that, when we checked, they’d never actually worked at in any real capacity.\n\nA big one that’s become increasingly common is people lying about the technology stacks they’ve used. You’d be shocked how many resumes list technologies like Kubernetes, Terraform, or Kafka as “production experience,” but when we ask follow-ups in the interview, it’s clear they’ve maybe followed a tutorial or briefly shadowed someone who worked with those tools.\n\nAnd here’s an important reality that most candidates (and even some hiring managers) don’t fully realize: background checks almost never verify WHAT you did. They usually just confirm your job title and employment dates. So if someone says they built a large-scale React application or ran infrastructure on AWS, there’s no background check that’s going to expose that as false. Unless an interviewer digs into the details, the exaggeration often goes completely unchallenged.\n\nAnd the thing is, many of these candidates still get interviews. Sometimes they even get offers. Not because they’re necessarily more skilled, but because their resumes are packed with the right keywords and “impact statements” that our systems and recruiters are trained to look for. Meanwhile, a candidate who honestly describes their experience with modest, accurate language often never even gets a shot.\n\nThis creates a really frustrating dynamic. The people who embellish tend to stand out in the resume pile, which pressures others to do the same just to keep up. And from where I’m sitting as a SWE involved in this process, that pressure is entirely on us, the hiring side, for building a system that rewards buzzwords and inflated claims over substance and honesty.\n\nSo if you’re sitting there wondering why you’re not getting callbacks despite real skills and solid experience, it might not be because you’re underqualified. It might just be that you’re competing with a lot of resumes that have been heavily optimized, or outright fabricated, for the hiring process. And unfortunately, those are the ones that often float to the top.\n\nOur team specifically now mostly just relies on references or \"people who know people\". We value that far more than trying to hire someone who noone on the team can speak about.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* People are inflating, exaggerating and lying on their resumes like you wouldn't believe.\n* The vast majority of honest candidates never even make it to the recruiter screening\n* I'm noticing it happen more and more (at least 70%+ of candidates who make it to onsite). Every resume has tons of impact, tons of metrics, tons of technologies. Yet the candidates can't speak about any of it in the interview.\n* I believe the blame is on the hiring side, not the candidates. It's been drilled into your heads to have metrics, impacts, and keywords to beat the ATS and impress recruiters\n* Our team is shifting to mostly just hiring people based on references instead. Far less risky.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm not sure what the solution is. Like I said, our team is now focused more on references than anything else but even that isn't a perfect system.",
