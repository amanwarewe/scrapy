If any issues pop up, the devs hop on it very quickly. \n\nThey deserve all the success and more. I know the expansion is taking forever, but if anyone has earned the right to take their time, its these guys. Its not like the game is some huge mass market, flavour of the month type of thing where you need to release your new content ASAP or you lose your audience.

You might be zoned out during a cutscene or conversation, but could inmediately check back it's contents on the PDA. This one i think feels easy enough to implement that should come back asap.\n- Artifact Variety: Artifacts feel like a step down from previous iterations. The negatives are always the same (varying degrees of radiation) and there's many that serve the same purpose (give literally the same benefits).\n\nI might have some minor grievances with the economy, repairs, incentives to do regular quests, but those are not fundamental issues and the system and economy work as is, for the most part.",

    "body": "D2 has been out on PC for less than 2 months. I was so close to buying it at 50% off over Black Friday weekend and I’m so glad I didn’t. Bungee was clever to release this DLC *after* everyone bought the game on sale. People just wanting to try Destiny for the first time and parents buying it for their kid’s Christmas not knowing that they’d actually have to pay more money if they wanted to continue playing the game they just bought in a matter of weeks due to DLC lockouts. This was overlooked in D1 and we cannot allow it to be overlooked again. Bungie could easily allow these players to continue playing the game they bought but that would cost more money for them and more server space. Instead they make the consumer pay up. In many ways this is *worse* than EA. EA locked stuff off but at least they did it from the start. Bungie has you pay $60 for a game and then took many parts of that away 2-3 months later if you didn’t pay up more money. The front page of reddit needs to be filled with complaints. Look what it did to EA. We can make a change to these horrible business practices at Bungie as well. \n\nFor those not in the know: Destiny 2’s DLC updates the games heroic strikes, raids, and nightfall. This is the main way of getting new gear and for many players the best parts of the game. With the DLC it **does not add on to the game but replaces content** that you already purchased. No longer can you run these strikes or raids if you don’t buy the DLC. Bungie is taking away content after you paid for it and placing it behind a paywall.",
