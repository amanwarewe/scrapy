During Modi tenure as CM, too many '**conspiracies**' to kill Modi were coming with Police **justifying encounters**, jailing **civil activists** in the wake of sensation created. This was shrewd media management tactic with police made to do dirty work. Then at national level it happened during **Bhima Koregaon protest**, the '**conspiracy' to kill Modi by Dalit activists** was alleged to break the accumulation of Dalit activists at Bhima Koregaon. Later cyber specialists found that 'emails' which were used to claim the conspiracy to kill Modi were a result of **trojan attack** on the laptop of the **sophistication** not available with normal computer hackers. But by then all of those protestors were behind bars and **public had lost memory** of the event by branding those as anti nationals.\n\nAfter these, today if police is used to break down **pollution protests** by giving coverage to '**communist sympathisers**', I am **hardly surprised**. \n\nThis trick was played during farmer protest too, but **unlike college protests**, the farmers were protesting not on issue but through **caste solidarity** which persisted or rather got aggravated after such attacks as people knew each other and did not budge. So now only the protests that are based on identity are successful, issue based protests by college kids who hardly know each other are broken by injecting or inciting a few morons to protest alongside and say anti national things. \n\nYet, I know I am talking to vacuum but I can not help it. It is unsettling. Downvotes do not matter hope more people know of this pattern.",

Furthermore, the Rupee has crossed the **₹89 mark against the USD** this month. If the logic of 2011 holds that high prices are a sign of 'failed governance' then the current silence from former activists is a mathematical contradiction that cannot be ignored",

It's high time we do something.\n\nYou see our dear PM has air purifiers installed, in the conference room, when he came to Delhi. \nSince BJP has come, they have just misused the religion for their personal propaganda. They allowed bursting crackers in Diwali. Which has caused a humongous rise in pollution levels. Still they boasted of green crackers and how it's in our religion to burst crackers.\n\nBut the real deal is these guys are all minting money behind our backs. They took money from cracker companies. , they are taking taxes from us. Now the dear CM of Delhi has increased the parking fares to combat pollution. ( Another way of money making).Atleast the odd even rule was somewhat fair. What's the deal in increasing the parking fares.\n\nYou know every independent system be it media or judiciary. These guys are bought everything. When AAP was there, every news channel used to cover about Delhi pollution. What about now? Does Delhi cease to exist , is it out of the map of India. There is radio silence . No one speaks. Not even a single media channel. If anyone speaks they are shut by power, voilence or by money.\n\n\nThese guys are so cheap that they are using water sprinklers near the pollution measuring machines just so as to show a decreased and incorrect AQI. \n\nIn the end they will loot our country, and let us die either sick or without money . What if our health deteriorates, will they come and pay for us? Do you see how lined up are government hospital. What is the CM of Delhi doing to improve it. We must protest.",
