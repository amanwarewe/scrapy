Maybe sometimes they want an escape from heavier writing or just want some spicy stories. Nothing wrong with that.\n\nIf they're new readers - I'd say Romantasy is the perfect entry point. The more new readers the better. Also, a good number of those might keep reading, eventually find the usual repeated tropes a bit boring as books go by, and maybe also start trying different stuff.\n\nAs long as people are still interested in reading, it can only be a good thing.\n\nPS: I'm a 34 yr old guy who's been consistently reading since I was 5. My girlfriend recently introduced me to ACOTAR - and I feel 0 guilt that I actually enjoyed the series and found it as a good 'palette cleanser' from some heavier stuff.",

Seems like a lot of us were taken in by these BS numbers.\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/culture/392971/men-reading-fiction-statistics-fact-checked\n\nAlways fact check! I'll leave the original comment up for context.\n\nIn North America 80% of all *fiction* book sales are made by women. Women are the largest fantasy demographic by no small margin. They are also now outreading men in sci-fi as well, and outread men in general across the board.\n\nWe are seeing a corresponding uptick in women authors to match this trend. In 2024 95% of all Tradpub YA books were published by women.\n\nWhat is one of the single largest factors behind this shift? Romance.\n\nRomance as a split-genre is becoming the norm. For people who only get their book recs on Reddit this may seem unbelievable but the reality is this place is extremely insular and only accounts for a fraction of a percent of readers. BookTok, Instagram etc is where book content lives.\n\nUntil we make a concerted shift to get young boys back reading, this trend is only going to increase in disparity. We need to make reading cool for men to do again. \n\nFor the record there is *absolutely nothing wrong with romance*. But for those who are upset about its inclusion everywhere, just know why. Market trends are a very hard thing to ignore.\n\nEdit: I dropped some sources in the comments!",

When people recommend books in this sub they usually point out that, “this is a classic medieval fantasy” or “this is an urban fantasy” or “this one is full of coming of age tropes” or what have you.\n\nFor some reason romantasy recs leave out that fact. I’ve bought a couple of books that sounded amazing from the recs and couldn’t get 5 chapters in because 90% of the writing was the thought track of some really obsessive, lonely person pining over some other figure that you know they’re going to end up with. They just happened to be in some sort of “fantasy” setting.\n\nLike others are pointing out, it’s not really about whether it’s a “legitimate” genre, it’s more that it’s a very specific niche that comes with a certain style of writing and themes which are oddly left out of discussions of the book. It almost seems intentional and subversive so it’s at best a bit eye-rolly but at worst a waste of time for people that are using this sub as a resource to find what interests them.",

I’m sure there are others who feel the same way. I just think women deserve better, and that they should push more stories that either have female leads or deal with being a woman but don’t have them fall in love with some 6 foot tall dark and brooding man who might be a little obsessive to a creepy degree. Women can get with other kinds of people or not get with anyone at all. Although these books exist they’re very overshadowed by romantasy and romance books in general I feel, and I find that disappointing. Romantasy has its place but other things deserve the spotlight as well. \n\nAlso I agree with the people saying it’s sometimes impossible to tell a book is romantasy sometimes based on the blurb. It’ll offhand mention one male character and the next thing you know, the entire book ends up being about having sloppy sex scenes with him every other chapter. I have to search up every book I may be interested in so I don’t waste my money on something I’m not interested in. And it’s just awkward to do that in public.\n\nEdit: I got some really weird responses to this. I’m not discrediting romantasy or the people who enjoy it. It’s still a valid genre and it’s completely valid to read what you enjoy. I’m more commenting on the fact it’s difficult to find other options easily without doing a ton of research because of how heavily this genre is pushed. Maybe I’m just lazy but I find this pretty irritating. I completely agree with other people in this thread saying second hand stores are a good way to find non romantasy books.
