A lot of places lean on \"old timey\" aesthetics that insist on putting designs at eye level. \"Wall-pack\" fixtures also are very bad at directing light in useful locations. Signage type lights (obviously) don't direct light downwards, and the long term trend has been to never turn them off. And there's an assumption that more photons == easier visibility (even if the lights are shining directly into your eyes) and less crime.\n\nThat last bit is important because you can see it in how the energy efficiency gains in switching to LEDs are being entirely spent on making things brighter.",

Many of the professors were outraged because for decades before that, benzene was the preferred solvent for washing one's hands when they came out of the lab.  \n\nThe idea was to wash off all the other deadly chemicals they were working with--with bare hands--so that they weren't tracked around campus via the door handles.  This would have been in the 1950s, I'm guessing.  So instead they were painting every door handle they used with benzene.  \n\nTo those guys benzene was a miracle substance, a mostly inert and gentle solvent that could be kept around open, and still be used as a valuable precursor chemical in many processes.  \n\nThese same professors were also aware of and very proud of the fact that their good practices had extended the life expectancy of a chemist from 25 years in the 1800s to almost average in the 1980s.  They certainly included the benzene as a part of those good practices.\n\nWe are almost certainly doing the same thing with an unknown number of other substances, right now.  The good part of it is that most of the dangers lurk just at or below our improving perception.  So even if they are dangerous, they aren't as dangerous as the stuff we routinely worked and lived with last century.",
