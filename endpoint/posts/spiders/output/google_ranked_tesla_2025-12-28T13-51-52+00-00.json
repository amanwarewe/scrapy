There is also a leaked song called “Celeste” (same name as the girl found in the Tesla) apparently has metadata from December 2023, with lyrics naming her and talking about being obsessed, sex, tattoos, etc. She was only 14 at the time.\n\nIn April 2024 she was officially reported missing at 13, but it looks like she was still in his orbit. By December that year, a friend says she drunkenly called, crying, throwing up, and spam-calling him saying she missed him. Right after that, she deleted her accounts and basically disappeared from online life completely.\n\nFastforward to 2025 and silence for months. Then he has a tour break at the end of August. A few days later, his Tesla gets abandoned and towed. On September 8, Celeste’s body is found in the Tesla, badly decomposed, stuffed in a bag.\n\nIt looks like this was years of grooming, secrecy, manipulation, and cover-ups.

            "body": "&gt;Tesla Inc. proposed a new compensation agreement for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk potentially valued at about $1 trillion, a massive package without precedent in corporate America.   \nThe long-awaited proposal, designed to incentivize Musk to lead Tesla for years to come, sets a series of ambitious benchmarks he must meet to earn the full payout, including expanding Tesla’s robotaxi business and growing the company’s market value to at least $8.5 trillion from around $1 trillion today. The plan spans 10 years.   \nThe additional shares Musk could receive would push his stake in the electric-vehicle maker to at least 25%, according to the terms detailed in Tesla’s proxy filing Friday. Musk has [publicly stated](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-15/elon-musk-wants-greater-control-of-tesla-before-building-its-ai) he wants a stake of that size.  \nThe plan dangles a financial windfall and expanded control of the company to Musk, already the world’s richest person, after his 2018 package valued in excess of $50 billion was struck down by a Delaware court. While Tesla appeals that decision, the board is seeking other ways to compensate its CEO, including with an [interim stock award](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/tesla-approves-interim-stock-award-for-musk-ahead-of-pay-vote) in early August valued at about $30 billion.   \nThe incentives in the new plan aim to keep Musk’s focus on Tesla while it pursues growth in newer markets including robotics and artificial intelligence. Friday’s proxy filing also included a non-binding shareholder proposal for Tesla to take a stake in Musk’s xAI startup, an idea Musk has [previously discussed](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/musk-puts-potential-xai-investment-back-on-tesla-shareholders).   \nThe new agreement underscores Musk’s iron grip on the automaker, despite the myriad demands on his time. Musk, who has served as Tesla’s top executive since 2008, oversees four other companies: [SpaceX](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/711339Z:US), [xAI](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0992657D:US), [Neuralink](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1534091D:US) and the [Boring Co.](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1521749D:US) He [told Bloomberg](https://archive.md/o/Oq9uN/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/musk-says-he-s-committed-to-being-tesla-ceo-for-next-five-years) in an interview in May that he’s committed to still being at the helm of Tesla in five years.
